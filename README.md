This is a repository that holds all of my dotfiles! (Or at least the ones I want to sync/share). I hope to make these
files easy to understand, use, and modify for anyone. I use GNU Stow to manage my dotfiles, so these should stay up to
date as long as I continue to use each dotfile's respective program (and I remember to git push). As these are my
dotfiles, they might not be perfect for you, so I encourage you to look through them and tweak them to your liking. If
any dotfile's program happens to be cross-platform (Linux/Windows), I will make an effort to make the dotfile
cross-platform as well.
